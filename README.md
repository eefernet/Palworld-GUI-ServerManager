## Description

Palworld Server manager might eventually get console commands as well using RCON to talk to the server, idk havent really looked into it yet but it would be neat

- Intelij (Learning coming from VSCode)
- Fat fingers

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
Make sure to have the latest update and/or have a recent version of java installed on your machine. Currently there are no availible builds, [check our current branches](https://github.com/eefernet/Palworld-GUI-ServerManager/branches) to see where development is heading. 

Dependencies not explicitly covered in the installation process; e.g., OS restrictions (Anything runs java)

### Install

~~Check releases tab on the right ->~~

- If you really want to try it out, 
1. Create empty folder anywhere on your computer
1. Make sure you have git installed
2. Run this command with CMD/terminal
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/eefernet/Palworld-GUI-ServerManager
   ```
3. Open up project in any given IDE of your choice.


### Configure

No need to configure, find a place to store your jar file and run it whenever you need. I dont think antimalware will have an issue but you might have to allow this jar file to run through your windows defender, etc...

### Usage

Feel free to use and share.

### Troubleshooting

Or FAQs, if that's more appropriate. Coming later.
